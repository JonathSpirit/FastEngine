 *
 * A good example is the callback system. When inheriting from Subscriber,
 * you will be able to subscribe a function to a CallbackHandler (inheriting from Subscription)
 * and you don't have to worry about unsubscribing it when the object is destroyed.
 *
 * A \b nullptr subscriber mean that you are subscribing something that is not class related.
 * (sort of a global scope).
 *
 * Alone this class will not do much as you have to implement the required functionality around it.
