## Description
![logo](https://github.com/JonathSpirit/FastEngine/blob/master/logo.png?raw=true) FastEngine is a 2D, multiplayer oriented framework on top of the [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) API. It brings a lot of tools and classes that can help mostly game development.

### Tools support
FastEngine must be built using a C++20 compatible compiler :
- For GNU/Linux : GCC-11 minimum
- For Windows : MINGW-W64, GCC-11 minimum
- - (32bits or UCRT 64bits)
- For MAC : AppleClang 13 minimum

Unsupported compiler/tools :
- Microsoft compiler, (it should work but is not tested on)
- Ninja build system

Working/supported architecture :
- 32bits
- 64bits
- ARM

FastEngine is built under C++20 but game/software that link to this library can be C++17 minimum

### Documentation
You can find the latest Doxygen docs here : https://jonathspirit.github.io/FastEngine/

Vulkan specification here : https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/index.html

Note that this is a young project that need a ton of works for examples, documentations, tutorials ...

##  How to build / Build details

You can check platform specific build instructions below this chapter.

First you should (if not already) clone the git repository :

    git clone https://github.com/JonathSpirit/FastEngine.git --recurse-submodules

You must first compile the dependencies by going into the **deps/** folder and then use CMake :

    cd deps
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .

Then you can go to the **root directory** and configure the project like this : (don't forget the FGE_DEPS_PATH option)

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -DFGE_DEPS_PATH=deps/build/libs -DFGE_BUILD_DOC=ON -DFGE_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DFGE_BUILD_TESTS=ON

Then use CMake to build the project (when building you can use the -j# argument to use multiple core) :

    cmake --build .

### CMake arguments
In order to tell CMake where to find the dependencies you have to specify the relative path to the **.../libs** folder generated by the **deps/CMakelists.txt** script :

    -DFGE_DEPS_PATH=deps/.../libs
You can specify the build type of the project by using :

    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release or Debug
By default, the project is in release mode.
You can build the Doxygen documentation by setting :

    -DFGE_BUILD_DOC=ON or OFF
By default, the documentation is built if the build type is **Release**. (You will need [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/) in order to build the doc.)

You can build all examples by setting :

    -DFGE_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON or OFF
By default, the all examples are built inside the **all** target.

The library type flag (**BUILD_SHARED_LIBS**) must not be manually set and static build is not supported.

You can enable/disable tests by setting :

    -DFGE_BUILD_TESTS=ON or OFF
By default, the tests is always built and in order to run the tests, you should use :

    ctest

### CMake targets
- **all**
- - This is the default target, it will build everything configured.
- **FastEngine**
- - This will build the client (audio, graphics, window, ...) shared library.
- **FastEngineServer**
- - This will build the server (no audio, graphics or window dependencies) shared library.
- **doc_doxygen**
- - This will build the Doxygen documentation.
- **install**
- - Install the project, you can configure the project with CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX in order to change the location, but by default, it will install it inside the **install/** directory in **root**.

You can also build every example targets.

### Windows
Please install a [MINGW-W64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) environment like [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) (recommended) and make sure that either 32bits and/or 64bits GCC is correctly installed with proper CMake package.

Then you should just do the following in a **build/** folder :

    cmake .. -G"MinGW Makefiles"
and then build :

    cmake --build .
I recommend to add a little bit of power in the build with multicore argument :

    cmake --build . -j8

### Linux
Please install GCC-11 or higher in order to correctly compile :

    sudo apt update && sudo apt install gcc-11 g++-11
And then use CMake :

    cmake .. -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-11 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-11
    cmake --build . -j8

### Mac OS
For Mac OS you should just be able to do (after installing a correct AppleClang version) :

    cmake .. -G"Unix Makefiles"
    cmake --build . -j8

### Installing
The **install** target support CMake config export, and all the dependencies will be exported too in order to avoid
any overhead when linking to the library.

Once built, you can use :
    
    cmake --install .

By default, if no CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is specified, it will install the library in **install/** in the project **root**
with a folder name like **FastEngine_Windows_64_Debug_0.9.1-441-g4a99f01**.

Once executed correctly, it will create a directory structure like this example :
- FastEngine_Windows_64_Debug_0.9.1-441-g4a99f01
  - bin
  - include
  - lib
  - share
  - - cmake
  - - external

  - - IMAGE_AUDIO_LOGO_LICENSE
