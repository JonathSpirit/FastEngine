## Description
![logo](https://github.com/JonathSpirit/FastEngine/blob/master/logo.png?raw=true) FastEngine is a multiplayer oriented framework-ish on top of the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library. It brings a lot of tools and classes that can help mostly game development.

### Tools support
FastEngine must be built using a C++20 compatible compiler :
- For GNU/Linux : GCC-11 minimum
- For Windows : MINGW-W64, GCC-11 minimum
- For MAC : AppleClang 13 minimum

Unsupported compiler/tools :
- Microsoft compiler, (it should work but is not tested on)
- Ninja build system

Working/supported architecture :
- 32bits
- 64bits
- ARM

FastEngine is built under C++20 but game/software that link to this library can be C++17 minimum

### Documentation
You can find latest Doxygen docs here : https://jonathspirit.github.io/FastEngine/

You can find SFML documentation here : https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/
and the repository : https://github.com/SFML/SFML

Note that this is a young project that need a ton of works for examples, documentations, tutorials ...

##  How to build / Build details

First you should (if not already) clone the git repository :

    git clone https://github.com/JonathSpirit/FastEngine.git
and updating submodules :

    git submodule init
    git submodule update --recursive
In order to correctly build the project, please create a **build/** folder at the *root* of the project.

### CMake arguments
You can force a 64/32 architecture type by using :

    -DFGE_ARCH=64 or 32
For ARM and others do not set this flag.
You can precise the build type of the project by using :

    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release or Debug
By default the project is in release mode.
You can build the Doxygen documentation by setting :

    -DFGE_BUILD_DOC=ON or OFF
By default the documentation is built if the build type is **Release**. (You will need [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/) in order to build the doc.)

You can build all examples by setting :

    -DFGE_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON or OFF
By default the all examples are built inside the **all** target.

The library type flag (**BUILD_SHARED_LIBS**) must not be manually set and static build is not supported.

You can enable/disable tests by setting :

    -DFGE_BUILD_TESTS=ON or OFF
By default the tests is always built and in order to run the tests, you should use :

    ctest

### CMake targets
- **all**
This is the default target, it will build **FastEngine_test** **FastEngine** and **FastEngineServer** with all the dependencies.
- **FastEngine##&&**
This will build the client (audio, graphics, window, ...) shared library.
- **FastEngineServer##&&**
This will build the server (no audio, graphics or window dependencies) shared library. Note that the server library will manually build bits of **SFML** sources in order to retain nice features like *sf::View* or *sf::Transform* but remove drawing capacity and OpenGL stuff.
- **FastEngine_test**
This is a simple, not optimized, all purpose, test executable in order to see if the project can run with some feature exposition.
- **install**
The install target is not supported **for now** and should not be used. In order to install the library please see go to the *Installing* section.

**##** is replaced with the architecture (32 or 64) and **&&** is replaced with **_d** if in debug mode or nothing otherwise.

### Windows
Please install a [MINGW-W64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) environment like [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) (recommended) and make sure that either 32bits and/or 64bits GCC is correctly installed with proper CMake package.

Then you should just do the following in a **build/** folder :

    cmake .. -G"MinGW Makefiles"
and then build :

    cmake --build .
I recommand to a add a little bit of power in the build with multicore argument :

    cmake --build . -j8

### Linux
Please install GCC-11 or higher in order to correctly compile :

    sudo apt update && sudo apt install gcc-11 g++-11
You should install [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/faq.php#grl-dependencies) dependencies too :

    sudo apt-get install libfreetype-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libudev-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev libflac-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libopenal-dev libxcursor-dev
And then use CMake :

    cmake .. -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-11 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-11
    cmake --build . -j8

### Mac OS
For Mac OS you should just be able to do :

    cmake .. -G"Unix Makefiles"
    cmake --build . -j8

### Installing
The **install** target is not supported for now. but you can use *fge_install* tool project in order to create a directory that will contain all necessary elements to use FastEngine.

Once built, you have to place the executable at the root and run it. You just have to follow prompts.

The tool is not really "friendly" for now and will only work if you have 4 build folders (on windows) :
- cmake-build-debug32
- cmake-build-debug64
- cmake-build-release32
- cmake-build-release64

As I work with [CLion ide](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) it's pretty easy to do, but this will change in order to accept all situations.

It will create a directory like this example :
- FastEngine_0.9.1-186-g6cb2357-dirty
  - bin32
  - bin64
  - include
  - lib32
  - lib64
  - require
  - fge_changelog.txt
  - IMAGE_LOGO_LICENSE
  - LICENSE
  - logo.png
